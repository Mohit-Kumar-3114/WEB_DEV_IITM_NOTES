Question- What is JavaScript?
Answer- JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language used to make web pages dynamic
and interactive, running both on the client-side and server-side. 




Question- What is client-side and server-side?
Answer- Client-side is the part of the website that runs on the user's browser, while server-side 
is the part of the website that runs on the server.




Question- What is high level programming language?
Answer- A high-level programming language is a programming language that is designed to be easy to 
read, write and understand for humans. It is translated into machine code (0s and 1s) by a compiler
or interpreter. Example: JavaScript, Python, Java, etc.




Question- What is low level language?
Answer- A low-level language is a language that is designed to be easy to understand by the machine. 
These are difficult to read and write for humans. Example: Assembly, Machine code, etc.




Question- What is strongly typed and weakly typed programming language?
Answer- A strongly typed programming language is a programming language that requires explicit type 
declarations for all variables. Example: Java, C++, etc. 
        A weakly typed programming language is a programming language that does not require explicit 
type declarations for all variables. Example: JavaScript, Python, etc.




Question- What are static and dynamic programming language?
Answer- A static programming language is a programming language that does not allow you to change the value 
of a variable at runtime. Example: Java, C++, etc. 
        A dynamic programming language is a programming language that allows you to change the value of 
a variable at runtime. Example: JavaScript, PHP, etc.




Question- What is compiled and interpreted programming language?
Answer-  A compiled language translates code from a high-level programming language into machine code before the 
program runs, producing a complete executable file that can run independently. Example: C, C++, etc. 
         An interpreted language translates code from a high-level programming language into machine code line 
by line as the code runs, without creating a separate executable file. Example: JavaScript, Python, etc.




Question- What is compile-time and runtime?
Answer- Compile-time refers to the phase during which a program is translated from the source code into 
machine code or an intermediate code by a compiler. Whereas run-time, or execution time, is the period when 
a program is actually running and performing its tasks on a computer.




Question- Explain single threaded nature of JavaScript?
Answer- JavaScript is a single-threaded language, meaning it can only execute one task at a time. This is 
because JavaScript uses a single call stack to manage its execution context. The call stack is a data
structure that stores the function calls in a last in, first out (LIFO) order. When a function is called, 
its execution context is pushed onto the call stack, and when the function completes, its execution 
context is popped off the call stack. This is why JavaScript is synchronous and blocking.
