Question- What is differnce between Javascript and ECMAscript?
ANswer- The primary difference between JavaScript and ECMAScript is that ECMAScript is a specification, while 
JavaScript is an implementation of that specification. In other words, ECMAScript defines what a scripting 
language should look like, while JavaScript is an actual implementation of that specification.




Question- What is V8 engine?
Answer- V8 refers to Google's open-source JavaScript engine. It's written in C++ and is used in Google Chrome and 
other Chromium-based browsers. V8 is known for compiling js code to native machine code before executing it.




Question- What is spider-monkey engine?
Answer- SpiderMonkey is Mozilla's JavaScript engine, handling how Firefox interprets and executes JavaScript code 
for web applications. It is written in RUST.




Question- What is node.js?
Answer- Node.js is a javascript runtime. It is neither a language nor a framework. It is built on V8 javascript 
engine. It is written in C++. It essentially allows us to run js code on backend. It is not tied to DOM. It is not 
ideal for cpu intensive tasks.




Question- What is bun?
Answer- Bun is a javascript runtime but faster than node.js. It is written in Zig.




Question- What is client-server architecture?
Answer- The communication between clients and servers in web-based systems follows a cyclical process known as the 
request-response cycle. On the client side, the request is constructed using essential components: headers, body, 
and method. Headers contain metadata about the request, specifying content types, accepted formats, and more. The 
body holds the actual data being sent, such as form inputs or JSON payloads. The method defines the action to be 
performed on the server, like retrieving data with GET or submitting information with POST.
            Once the client sends this request, the server receives it and begins processing. It interprets the 
headers, body, and method to understand the client's intent. The server then generates a response, 
composing headers and potentially constructing a body that contains the requested data. Alongside this, 
the server assigns a status code to the response, indicating the outcome of the request, whether it was 
successful (200 OK) or encountered an error (404 Not Found).
            Upon receiving the server's response, the client interprets the status code to understand the result. 




Question- What is protocol?
Answer- A protocol is a set of rules and conventions that defines how data is transmitted and received between
devices.




Question- What is http?
Answer- HTTP is the primary protocol for transmission of information across the Internet. It allows frontend to 
talk with the backend.




Question- What is https?
Answer- Hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) is the secure version of HTTP, which is the primary protocol
for transmission of information across the Internet. HTTPS is encrypted in order to increase security of data
transfer. This is particularly important when users transmit sensitive data, such as by logging into a bank 
account, email service, or health insurance provider.




Question- What is http server?
Answer- An HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) server is a type of software or service that handles incoming HTTP 
requests from clients (such as web browsers) and processes those requests to deliver web content or perform various 
actions based on the request.




Question- What is status code?
Answer- Status codes in HTTP are three-digit numbers sent by servers to tell clients if their request was successful 
(2xx), had errors on the client side (4xx), had errors on the server side (5xx), required a redirect (3xx), or 
carried specific information (1xx). They're quick signals that help understand what happened with a request.




Question- What is IP address and domain name?
Ansswer- An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a 
computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. A domain name is a human-readable label used to 
identify a specific location or entity on the internet. 




Question- What is network?
Answer-  A computer network is a system that connects two or more computing devices for transmitting and sharing 
information.




Question- What is local host?
Answer- In simpler terms, when you access "localhost" in a web browser or any other application, you are actually 
referring to your own computer. This allows you to view and interact with web applications running on your local 
machine.




Question- What is dns?
Answer- DNS stands for Domain Name System. It is a naming system used to translate human-readable domain names 
(like www.example.com) into IP addresses (such as 192.0.2.1) that computers use to identify each other on a network.




Question- What is express.js?
Answer- Express is a minimal and flexible web application framework for Node.js, designed to build web applications 
and APIs. It's one of the most popular frameworks used in the Node.js ecosystem due to its simplicity, scalability, 
and extensibility. To load the express module we use require() method. For example: const express = require("express").
If function is not globally found then write npm init -y and npm install express in integrated terminal.




Question- What is rest api?
Answer- RESTful API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a software architectural 
style for designing networked applications. It utilizes a stateless client-server communication protocol, typically 
over HTTP, where clients can access and manipulate resources on a server using a predefined set of operations, such 
as HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). In the context of a RESTful API, "stateless" means that the server does 
not store any information about the client's previous interactions or requests.




Question- What is difference between library and framework?
Answer- Libraries are like tools in a toolbox that you can use when needed; you control when and how you use them 
in your code. Frameworks are like a blueprint or a set of rules that define how you build something; you work within 
the framework's structure and guidelines.




Question- What is port?
Answer- Web server ports are the logical endpoints of a network connection that is used to exchange information 
between a web server and a web client. These ports are assigned a unique number to identify them separately.



Question- What is npm and npx?
Answer- NPM is a package manager used to install, delete, and update Javascript packages on your machine. NPX is a 
package executer, and is used to execute javascript packages directly, without installing them locally or globally.





Question- What are http requests?
Answer- In an HTTP server, a client can make various types of requests to interact with the server and retrieve or 
send data. The most common types of HTTP requests are:
1. GET: Used to request data from a specified resource.
2. POST: Used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.
3. PUT: Similar to POST, but used to update a resource or create a new one if it doesn't exist.
4. DELETE: Deletes the specified resource.





Question- What is the difference between get and post request?
Answer- GET Request:
1. Usage: Used to request data from a specified resource.
2. Data Handling: Sends data via the URL parameters (query string).
3. Visibility: Parameters are visible in the URL.
4. Security: Less secure for sensitive data as data is visible in the URL.
5. Example of a GET request: https://example.com/api/products?id=123

POST Request:
1. Usage: Used to submit data to be processed to a specified resource.
2. Data Handling: Sends data in the body of the HTTP request.
3. Visibility: Data is not visible in the URL.
4. Security: More secure for sensitive data as data is not visible in the URL.
5. Example of a POST request: https://example.com/api/products   Body: { "id": 123 }





Question- What does app listen mean?
Answer- The app.listen() function starts the Express server and makes it listen on the specified port.
