Question- What is react?
Answer- ReactJS is an open-source JavaScript library used to create user interfaces. For dynamic websites, these 
libraries make it easier to do DOM manipulation. React is just an easier way to write normal HTML/CSS/JS. It’s a 
new syntax, that under the hood gets converted to HTML/CSS/JS using npm run build.




Question- What is virtual dom?
Answer- The Virtual DOM in React is a lightweight representation of the Real DOM. When your app changes, React 
updates the Virtual DOM first, then compares it with its previous Virtual DOM to detect changes (a process called 
"diffing"). After identifying differences, React updates only the specific parts of the Real DOM that have changed. 
This approach avoids re-rendering large sections or the entire page. The Virtual DOM ensures a smoother and faster 
user experience.




Question- What is state, components and re-rendering in react?
Answer- State in React is a way to store and manage data that can change over time like the value of a counter.
Components are self-contained, reusable pieces of code that work like JavaScript functions but return HTML. The 
Button component, for example, takes the state (count) as an input and updates how it looks based on that state. 
Re-rendering in React refers to the process of updating the visual representation of a component in response to 
changes in its state or props.




Question- What is jsx?
Answer- JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript used with React, allowing developers to write 
HTML-like code in their JavaScript files.




Question- What are props?
Answer- In React, props (short for properties) are a way to pass data from a parent component to a child component. 
Props in React are read-only. A child component cannot modify the props it receives from a parent. Props are 
immutable.




Question- What is single page application?
Answer- A Single Page Application (SPA) is a web app that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates its 
content using JavaScript without fully reloading the page, giving a smoother and faster user experience. Frameworks
libraries like React are commonly used to build SPAs.
